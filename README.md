**TandemLoop** is a private, self-hosted collaboration platform for small teams.  
It integrates chat, file sharing, tasks, and notes into a unified workspace — so you own your data, without bloated enterprise complexity.

## 🚀 Why TandemLoop?

- **Own your data** — Run on your own hardware, virtual machine, or cloud. No vendor lock-in.  
- **Focus on collaboration** — Channels & DMs, file buckets, task cards, rich-text notes. One tool, many workflows.  
- **Stay lightweight** — Minimal dependencies, streamlined UX, optimized for productivity.  
- **Modular and extensible** — Start simple, scale features (boards, sync, integrations) at your pace.

## 🎯 Target Use-Cases

- Small teams (5–50 people) who need internal chat, shared files, task tracking and lightweight notes.  
- Projects or companies that prefer self-hosting, strong data ownership, and limited external dependencies.  
- Teams that want a single platform (not piecing together dozens of tools) and still maintain flexibility.

## 🧩 Core Features (in development)

- **Channels & Direct Messages** — threaded replies, mentions, reactions.  
- **File Buckets** — drag-and-drop uploads, previews, passcode links for sharing.  
- **Tasks** — lightweight cards with owner, due date, status; quick creation via slash command.  
- **Notes** — rich-text documents with inline attachments, slash commands, version history.  
- **Presence & Status** — know who’s online, set status messages, maintain privacy-optimized presence.  
- **Keyboard Shortcuts & Quick Actions** — jump to channels, create tasks or notes in one keystroke.  
- **Themes** — dark mode by default, customizable accent colours.  
- **Smart Notifications** — mention alerts, per-channel controls, minimal noise.

## 🗺 Roadmap

- **v0.1.0 — Aberdeen** – Private preview: channels, files, tasks, notes  
- **v0.2.0 — Albright** – Boards (kanban), filters, swimlanes  
- **v1.0.0 — Anchor** – Stable public release: packaging (Docker), admin & roles, backups, integrations
